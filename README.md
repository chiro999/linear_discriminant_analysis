LDA stands for Linear Discriminant Analysis. It's a dimensionality reduction and classification technique used in statistics, machine learning, and pattern recognition. 
 LDA is primarily used for finding a linear combination of features that best separates different classes in a dataset, while also reducing the dimensionality of the data.
